I'm a tech enthusiast who loves building things with code, exploring new technologies, and diving deep into problem-solving. I enjoy creating projects that address real-world challenges and experimenting with different ideas, whether it’s through web development, databases, or software engineering. For me, technology isn’t just about tools or programming languages—it’s about creativity, logic, and the excitement of turning concepts into something real and useful. I also have a strong interest in mathematics, as I enjoy how numbers and logic can be applied to solve complex problems and strengthen analytical thinking.




### 🌱 Outside of Tech  
🎮 I love discovering new interests, diving into creative hobbies, and finding inspiration from **books, games, music, and Korean dramas**.  
🌍 For me, technology is not just a skillset but also a way to keep **learning, growing, and connecting** with the world around me. 🚀
